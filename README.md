# Java Coding Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jigish Parghi â€” Senior Java Developer with 15+ years of experience.

This repository is my curated coding portfolio:
- Java fundamentals (arrays, strings, OOP)
- Collections and data structures
- Algorithms & problem-solving patterns
- Advanced Java concepts
- End-to-end mini projects with documentation & demos

It demonstrates coding fluency, clean code, and production-minded design.
See each folder's README for details.
